# Reference

### Simulation

##### A formation control project **deployed** on Turtlebot3 by Cambridge team [Git](https://github.com/jc-bao/turtlebot3_formation) [Paper](https://andreaferlini.github.io/pdf_files/p15-Solot.pdf) 

### Hardware Implementation

##### ðŸŒŸDiff drive with Jetson Nano and Arduino [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uz_i_sjVhIM) [Git](https://github.com/jc-bao/Autonomous_Mobile_Robot) [Website](https://www.rosroboticslearning.com/)

Pros: 

* a well-done project control with Arduino with **open source** code.
* **ROS navigation** package implemented. 

Cons: 

* not using ROS Serial, need futher work. 

##### Self driving car with Jetson Nano based on Arduino [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syphzPxnozA) [Website](https://www.murtazahassan.com/courses/self-driving-car-with-jetson-nano-and-arduino/)

Pros: 

* With detailed **hardware demostration**.

Cons: 

* only has finished arduino part and not open source.

##### James Bruton's project on ROS [Video](https://github.com/jc-bao/ReallyUsefulRobot) [Git](https://github.com/jc-bao/ReallyUsefulRobot) 

Pros:

* Open source
* Works on NVIDIA Xavier NX
* gmapping and navgation works fine.

Cons:

* Different motor and model
